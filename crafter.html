            <p class="biography">
                She was born on September 5th, 1966 in Santa Elena, Ecuador. With few resources but with big dreams to achieve, from a very young age she worked hard on each of her goals, willing to do and learn everything that was possible for her. From dance enthusiast, to elite athlete, to electrical technician, her greatest hobby was perfecting her talents.

                She started at an early age to be interested in handicrafts, any kind of work where she needed to use her hands were always her favorite and nowadays making crafts with foamy is her specialty. Atelier Nenita is the name with which she baptized her craft workshop, Atelier in French means Workshop and Nenita is a diminutive of her nickname Nena.
                
                Her projects have spread internationally thanks to social networks, currently her facebook page has around 4000 active followers! The creator of these projects constantly offers mini courses to get started in the world of foamy dolls, she also sells classrooms of her creations at a reasonable price and sometimes offers free live workshops on her facebook page. Rosa Elena Santander Bermeo today continues to make projects and collaborations with many other pages that are dedicated to the same field.
